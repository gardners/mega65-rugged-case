MEGA65 / MEGAphone Rugged Case Design

Designed to fit a MEGA65 (plus MEGAphone communications hardware)
into a Tactix Large Tough Case

Detailed assembly instructions will be developed going forward (it's initially intended only for the MEGAphone development team to implement), as we get community members to replicate it, but it is fairly self-explanatory as you go through, with the following points:
1. The upper file is for the LCD panel and driver boards. 
2. The four lower cuts are for the keyboard, floppy drive, MEGA65 FPGA board and ancilliaries and cellular module plus battery, respectively.
3. All fixings are M3.  All panel spacers are 25mm metal spacers to suit M3 screws.  All fixings and spacers can be purchased in Australia from Jaycar Electronics.  Equivalents will be easily available in other countries.
4. Once the full deck is assembled, it slides fairly easily into the lower-shell of the case, but fits snugly enough that it doesn't need fixing in place.
5. The LCD panel bezel assembly does need fixing in place, and the panel cut-out that holds the driver boards can be laid against the rear of the lid, centred horizontally, and used as a guide for drilling the 3mm holes in the lid.  The vertical positioning pieces allow for vertical adjustment of the position of the panel and it's screws through the case lid, so that the exact vertical positioning of the holes in the lid do not need to be precise, which can otherwise be difficult to achieve.
