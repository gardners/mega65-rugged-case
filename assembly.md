## Lower Half

0. Laser cut each of the panels.
1. Assemble the keyboard panel (lower-laser-cut.svg) and fit either a MEGA65 retail keyboard or a MEGA65 DIY keyboard.
2. Assemble the floppyd drive panel (lower-deck-2-laser-cut.svg), fitting a standard PC 1.44MB floppy drive.
   If you don't have a floppy drive, you will need a spacer of the same height.
3. Use M3x6mm screws to connect the two together where the holes line up with threaded hexes from the other panel.
